### Requirements

You will need [Node.js] with [npm], [Yarn], and a [Node.js debugging] client.

Be sure that all commands run under the correct Node version, e.g.,
if using [nvm], install the correct version with

```
$ nvm install
```

Set the active version for each shell session with

```
$ nvm use
```

Install the development dependencies with

```
$ yarn install
```

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[Node.js debugging]: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/
[nvm]: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

### Publishing

Use the [`npm version`][npm-version] command to release a new version.
This will push a new git tag which will trigger a GitHub action.

Publishing may be triggered using on the web
using a [workflow_dispatch on GitHub Actions].

[npm-version]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version
[workflow_dispatch on GitHub Actions]: https://github.com/pureskillgg/ace/actions?query=workflow%3Aversion

## GitHub Actions

_GitHub Actions should already be configured: this section is for reference only._

The following repository secrets must be set on [GitHub Actions]:

- `GH_TOKEN`: A personal access token to read and write packages.

These must be set manually.

### Secrets for GitHub Action to Cut Version (Optional)

The version GitHub action requires a user with write access to the repository
including access to read and write packages.
Set these additional secrets to enable the action:

- `GH_TOKEN`: A personal access token for the user.
- `GH_USER`: The Github user's username.
- `GIT_USER_NAME`: The Github user's real name.
- `GIT_USER_EMAIL`: The Github user's email.
- `GPG_PASSPHRASE`: The Github user's GPG passphrase.
- `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`: The Github user's [GPG private key].
